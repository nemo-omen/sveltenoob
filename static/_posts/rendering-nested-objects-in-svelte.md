Hi.

Total beginner here.

I've been re-learning some basic web development over the past few weeks and, along with vanilla JS, I've been working on a project in Svelte. One of the stumbling blocks for me was iterating through nested objects â€” actually, objects inside arrays ... inside objects ... inside arrays.

This may have been completely obvious to most people working with JavaScript or Svelte but, as a newbie, the way Svelte makes iterating through nested objects *so* easy came as a revelation.

Let's pretend we have an array of *Real Jabronis* in our code, those Jabronis carry with them an array of *Lame Moves*.
```javascript
const realJabronis = [
		{
			name: 'Soda Popinski',
			age: 43,
			height: '6\'5"',
			lameMoves: [
				{
					name: 'Triple Trotting Jab',
					power: 0.5,
					delay: 0.3
				},
				{
					name: 'Just an Uppercut',
					power: 0.9,
					delay: 0.6
				}
			]
		},
		{
			name: 'Kin Corn Karn',
			age: 35,
			height: '5\'11"',
			lameMoves: [
				{
					name: 'Mongolian Chop',
					power: 0.5,
					delay: 0.4
				},
				{
					name: 'Karate Kick',
					power: 0.9,
					delay: 0.6
				}
			]
		}
	];
```

Now let's pretend we're training an up-and-coming fighter and they need a list of the *Lame Moves* they need to train for if they want to fight these *Real Jabronis*. Svelte makes this **stupid easy**:

```html
{#each realJabronis as realJabroni}
	<h1>{realJabroni.name}</h1>
	<h2>Lame Moves to Train For</h2>
	{#each realJabroni.lameMoves as lameMove}
		<h3>Move Name: {lameMove.name}</h3>
		<p><strong>Power: {lameMove.power}</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Delay: {lameMove.delay}</strong></p>
	{/each}
{/each}
```

And you basically get exactly what you need.

You can also, if you want to use components in these iterations (and you know you do,) pass each of these iteration levels into your component through props:

```html
{#each realJabronis as realJabroni}
	<RealJabroni name={realJabroni.name} lameMoves={realJabroni.lameMoves} />
{/each}
```

And, of course, `export let lameMoves = [];` from inside `RealJabronis.svelte` will give you a nice array to work with.

**What tips do you have for iterating through nested objects and arrays in Vanilla JS?**
