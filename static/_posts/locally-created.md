This is a post I created on my local machine and then pushed to github. I;m trying to see if Netlify will auto-deploy on push. If it does, I'll probably just ditch the netlify cms for most of my posts unless I'm posting remotely.

```javascript
function highlightMe() {
  console.log('This is a javascript block I\'d like to have highlighted');
};
```
